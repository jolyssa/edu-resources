# **Still TO DO:**

#### Filter on ResourceListings.jsx

* [X] Fix filter: make it work.
* [X] Fix filter: margins on x axis, fit with resources.

#### Add Resources Route /add-resources

* [ ] Add resources: if not signed in, redirect to login page
* [ ] Edit resources: the same
* [X] addResources button: homecards and navbar

#### Legacy Resources

* [ ] Import existing posts to Jj's account****

#### Misc

* [ ] Get new fav icon
* [ ] Local passport integration

### FUTURE UPDATES:

* [ ] People can create lists (like GitHub w/ stars, create a list and add resources to a list)
